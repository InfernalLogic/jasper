<!--title:Using Sql Server with Jasper-->

The Jasper.Persistence.SqlServer Nuget library provides Jasper users with a quick way to integrate Sql Server-backed persistence into their
Jasper applications. To get started, just add the *Jasper.Persistence.SqlServer* Nuget to your project, and enable the persistence like this:

snippet: sample_AppUsingSqlServer

Enabling this configuration adds a couple things to your system:

* Service registrations in your IoC container for `DbConnection` and `SqlConnection`, with the `Scoped` lifecycle
* "Outbox" pattern usage with Sql Server as demonstrated below
* Message persistence using your application's Sql Server database, including outbox support with Sql Server and durable message persistence using Sql Server
* Support for the `[Transactional]` attribute as shown below

## Transactional Middleware

Assuming that the Jasper.Persistence.SqlServer Nuget is referenced by your project, you can use the `[Transactional]` attribute on message (or HTTP) handler methods to wrap the message handling inside
a single Sql Server transaction like so:

snippet: sample_UsingSqlTransaction

When you use this middleware, be sure to pull in the current `SqlTransaction` object as a parameter to your handler method.

 ## "Outbox" Pattern Usage

See [Jasper’s “Outbox” Pattern Support](https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/04/16/jaspers-outbox-pattern-support/) for more context around why you would care about the "outbox" pattern.

Jasper supports the ["outbox" pattern](https://jimmybogard.com/refactoring-towards-resilience-evaluating-coupling/) with Sql Server connections. You can explicitly opt into this usage with code like this:

snippet: sample_basic_sql_server_outbox_sample

If you use the `[Transaction]` middleware in a message handler, the middleware will take care of some of the repetitive mechanics for you. In the code below, the `IMessageContext` is enrolled in the current transaction before the action runs, and the outgoing messages
are flushed into the outgoing sending queue after the action runs.

snippet: sample_SqlServerOutboxWithSqlTransaction

## Message Persistence Schema

The message persistence requires and adds these tables to your schema:

1. `jasper_incoming_envelopes` - stores incoming and scheduled envelopes until they are successfully processed
1. `jasper_outgoing_envelopes` - stores outgoing envelopes until they are successfully sent through the transports
1. `jasper_dead_letters` - stores "dead letter" envelopes that could not be processed. See <[linkto:documentation/execution/dead_letter_queue]> for more information
1. `EnvelopeIdList` - table type that is used by some of the functions listed below

and also these functions that are all used by the durable messaging in its "message recovery" functionality:

1. `uspDeleteIncomingEnvelopes` 
1. `uspDeleteOutgoingEnvelopes` 
1. `uspDiscardAndReassignOutgoing` 
1. `uspMarkIncomingOwnership` 
1. `uspMarkOutgoingOwnership`

## Managing the Sql Server Schema

In testing, you can build -- or rebuild -- the message storage in your system with a call to the `RebuildMessageStorage() ` extension method off of either `IWebHost` or `IJasperHost` as shown below in a sample taken from xUnit integration testing with Jasper:

snippet: sample_MyJasperAppFixture

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/JasperFx/jasper/issues/372) for some utilities to better manage the database objects.
